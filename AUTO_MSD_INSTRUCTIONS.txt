AUTOMATIC MSD GUI

*Documentation for the automatic MSD GUI*

This program returns the mean square displacement given a set of X, Y and optionally t (time) datapoints.

--------------- PROCEDURE ---------------------

1- Make a spreadsheet file with two to three columns: the first and second ones must be the X and Y positions, with the first row being a capital "X" or a capital "Y". If there's time datapoints add a third column with a lowercase letter "t" on the first row.

| X | Y | t |
| 2 | 3 | 0.5|
| 2 | 4 | 2.5 |
| 3 | 6 | 3 |
...

2- Save the file as ".csv" (comma delimited)

3- Run the program, selecting the file (more info on the options below)

4- A new .csv file with an added ending "_MSD.csv" will appear, with the displacement and the MSD in the third and fourth columns, respectively.


--------------- GUI PARAMETERS ---------------------

If your set of datapoints are taken at the same time intervals then no parameters are needed. 

If your set of datapoints are not taken at the same time intervals then a different procedure is done to calculate the MSD:

-The positions are first interpolated with a continuous function
-The continuous function is sampled at equal time intervals
-Finally the MSD is calculated from the sampled datapoints

The different parameters are:

-Type of interpolation: spline or linear. Linear is less accurate but less prone to errors, spline is smoother and more "natural" but can fail more easily.


-Number of points: amount of samples taken from the interpolation.

-Show figure: shows the plot of the interpolated data (good to check if there's been some mistakes in the interpolation)
